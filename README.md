## Inspiration
We were inspired by the disconnect between traditional Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Canvas and modern student engagement. While Canvas provides essential academic tools, it often feels like a digital filing cabinet rather than an engaging learning environment. We noticed that students lack:

-> Motivational feedback loops in their academic journey

-> Visual progress tracking that makes learning satisfying

-> Healthy competition that drives improvement

-> Predictive insights about their academic performance

## What it does

CanvasFlow transforms the Canvas experience from a passive grade viewer into an active learning companion:

üéØ Smart Dashboard
- Aggregates all courses and assignments in one intuitive interface

- Provides real-time grade calculations and progress tracking

- Displays predictive analytics for future performance

üèÜ Gamified Learning
- Course leaderboards that rank performance across all classes

- Study streaks to build consistent academic habits

- Achievement tracking for perfect scores and milestones

üîí Secure Integration
- Direct Canvas API integration with token-based authentication

- Real-time synchronization with institutional Canvas instances

- Zero data storage on our servers for maximum privacy

## How we built it

We built the frontend using React 18 with modern hooks for state management. The key innovation was creating a unified data layer that processes nested Canvas API responses into actionable insights.

Our Python FastAPI backend serves as a secure bridge between the React frontend and Canvas API, handling authentication, rate limiting, and data normalization.

Key technical decisions:
Token-based Auth: No server-side storage of sensitive data

Real-time Processing: All calculations happen client-side for performance

Responsive Design: Mobile-first CSS with graceful degradation

Modular Architecture: Easy to extend with new gamification features

## Challenges we ran into

State Management
Managing the complex state relationships between courses, assignments, and submissions required careful React hook usage to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

Canvas API Integration
Learning the Canvas API and integrating the datafields into our project

Cross Platform Errors


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
